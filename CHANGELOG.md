# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file and in
the individual wave records under [`docs/waves/`](docs/waves/).

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
This project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.3.32] - 2026-06-03

### Added

- Public-launch README rewrite: symptom-first opening, audience qualifier, install walkthrough with named operator-visible signals, "Your first wave" three-turn transcript with intentional close-gate refusal, "What is installed" tree with per-directory roles and gitignore footnote, host coverage table, Design principles, "For teams" evaluation answers, Built-with-Wavefoundry as Contributing introduction
- Auto-syncing version badge derived from GitHub Releases
- Archetype Council review surface — stance-based council with five canonical seats (Sun Tzu, Yoda, Spock, Marcus Aurelius, Feynman) and documented Hemingway / Munger swap-ins; optional, operator-invoked; complements Wave Council
- New shortcut phrase `Archetype review` / `Archetype council` added to public command catalog and AGENTS.md
- `[~]` AC and task checkbox state for "intentionally not met" — required-priority `[~]` ACs lint-require an inline status note; tasks accept `[~]` without note (asymmetric per priority weight)
- `wave_close` close-time hard gate: every AC and task across admitted changes must be `[x]` or `[~]` before close; silent `[ ]` blocks with `silent_unchecked_items_at_close` diagnostic naming change-id + item-type + identifier; `not-this-scope` priority ACs exempt
- Dashboard renders `[~]` items with distinct glyph (`~`), italic muted text, "deferred" badge replacing the priority badge, and "· N deferred" suffix on progress fractions
- Dashboard progress denominators exclude `[~]` items so a fully-met change with deferred ACs renders as complete
- `wave_index_build` response carries `stranded_rows_reaped` and `stranded_rows_reaped_by_table`

### Changed

- `docs/prompts/index.md` opening framing rewritten without internal seed-IDs; Public Commands table and Legacy Aliases table preserved verbatim
- `docs/references/project-overview.md` refreshed
- AC dialog and Task dialog glyphs are bold and slightly larger (1rem) so all three states stand out

### Fixed

- LanceDB orphan-row reaper on incremental index update — reconciles the LanceDB row set against the current eligible set on every `mode='update'` so rows for paths excluded by workflow-config narrowing are removed without requiring a full rebuild; reaps both `docs` and `code` tables regardless of `content` arg
- Project-layer audit eligibility filter (`_layer_current_hashes`) now honors workflow-config `project_include_prefixes` opt-ins, matching the indexer's actual `files_for_meta` computation; eliminates false-positive "removed paths" signal when a repo opts in framework paths via `code.project_include_prefixes`

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-24

### Added

- Full Wave Framework lifecycle: plan, create, prepare, implement, review, close
- Local MCP server with 47 tools across wave lifecycle, docs/code search, audit, and framework navigation
- Semantic search index built on fastembed and BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5 (fully offline)
- Three-dimension feedback harness: maintainability (computational sensors), architecture and security/performance (inferential sensor lanes)
- Wave Council protocol for multi-reviewer governance
- 214 seed prompts covering the full agent operating surface
- Stage gates enforced by the server: prepare gate, required reviewer lanes, operator signoff
- Distribution packaging (`build_pack.py`) and upgrade flow (`upgrade_wavefoundry.py`)
- Multi-host agent support: Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Copilot, Junie, Windsurf, Air, Warp
- Semver versioning with lifecycle-prefix build metadata
- Python tool venv at `~/.wavefoundry/venv` (no system Python modification)
- Dashboard server for portfolio visibility
