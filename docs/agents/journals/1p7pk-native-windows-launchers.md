wave-id: `1p7pk native-windows-launchers`

## Operating Identity

- **Role:** wave-coordinator for wave `1p7pk native-windows-launchers`. **Responsibility:** coordinate the wave's admitted changes through prepare → implement → review → close per the lifecycle contract.

## Salience Triggers

- **critical** — operator directives that change wave scope, admitted changes, or close authorization
- **high** — review-time findings that block close, dependency changes between admitted changes
- **medium** — implementation-time observations about scope drift or unexpected blockers
- **low** — routine coordination notes, status updates, lint pass/fail signals

## Default Stance

Maintain the wave's load-bearing invariants throughout implementation. Preserve the change-doc contracts admitted at prepare time; surface drift from operator immediately rather than silently absorbing scope.

## Memory Responsibilities

- Track per-change implementation state (gate-open/close pairs, AC completion, follow-up findings)
- Record decisions made during implementation that affected scope, AC formulation, or test strategy

## Active Signals

- Pending: wave `1p7pk native-windows-launchers` opened 2026-06-24; populate as admitted changes move through implementation.

## Distillation

- Pending: distilled lessons emerge as the wave delivers; promote durable findings to `docs/agents/journals/README.md` at close.

## Promotion Evidence

- Pending: promotion candidates against `docs/agents/journals/README.md` emerge as the wave delivers and durable lessons are identified.

## Retirement And Supersession

- Pending: retirement happens at wave close per the closure contract in `docs/agents/journals/README.md`.

## Governance

- This journal follows the operating-memory contract in `docs/agents/journals/README.md`. Critical/high signals may be journaled during planning, implementation, review, handoff, reindex, or closure — not only at close. Distillation, promotion, and retirement happen at close.
