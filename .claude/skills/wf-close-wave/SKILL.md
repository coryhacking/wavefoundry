# Close a wave (Wavefoundry skill)

This skill is a thin pointer: the workflow lives in `docs/prompts/close-wave.prompt.md`. Read that document and follow it; do not improvise the steps from this summary.

- Prefer the `wf_close_wave` MCP tool; run `dry_run` freely to validate close readiness.
- Gate reminder: closure is operator-owned. Call `mode="create"` only when the operator explicitly instructs closure in the current request; closure is never inferred from adjacent actions such as "run the review" or "fix the tests".
- Single-change variant: Finalize feature (`docs/prompts/finalize-feature.prompt.md`).
